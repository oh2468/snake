# Simon Says

## Description

A classic game of snake with the addition of two new modes/difficulties. The standard mode is the classic snake game. The walls mode spaws random walls as obstacles on the field that you have to dodge. The poison mode builds on the previous walls mode by also spwaning three poisoned apples each time you eat the safe apple. The game speed also incrementally increases as you go on and become longer. The scores are stored in a local database for future reference and state. You can also view them in the game seperated by mode or all at once.

## Getting Started

Download all the dependecies, then run the game from a terminal e.g.: ```python snake.py``` (The terminal needs to be in the same directory as the game files.)
You can puase the game by hitting space when it's running.
You can fast forward the movement of the snake by holding down the direction you're traveling in.
The game comes with instructions that you can read once the main menu is up and running.
